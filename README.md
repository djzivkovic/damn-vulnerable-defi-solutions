# Damn Vulnerable DeFi Solutions

## Project Status: Abandoned

Please note that this project is currently abandoned. I moved on to other projects and learning opportunities, and as a result, this repository is not actively maintained or updated. Feel free to fork and continue the work if you find it useful.

## About

This repository contains my solutions for the first 8 challenges on [Damn Vulnerable DeFi](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/). I worked on these challenges as part of my practice in Solidity and to enhance my understanding of decentralized finance (DeFi) concepts.

## Note

These solutions were developed as part of my learning journey in Solidity and DeFi. They may not represent best practices or optimal solutions. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
